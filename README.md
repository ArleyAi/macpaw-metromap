You can watch short youtube video that demonstrates app:

All the code was written by me. 

Also I used FirstFloor.ModernUI(https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui/tree/master/1.0/FirstFloor.ModernUI) for UI beautification.

P.S. The application was developed in one day, because I had found out about innternature a few days before the deadline :)
